# odin_recipes

The current project is an excercise in using simple html to create a homepage which links to different cooking recipes. The project is intended to demonstrate understanding of a website's file system, basic structure of html files and various html elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images and links. Within this project usage of version control in the form of git/github is also demonstrated with an emphasis on writing intelligible commit messages.
